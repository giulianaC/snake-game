# Snake Game

_Hello python world, here is my first project / game where I use the turtle python module_

## Let's go ðŸš€

_This is a little python code that allows us to develop the snake game. I developed this code following the instructions of "Mundo python" on YouTube._

### Pre requirements ðŸ“‹

_You don't need to know much about python, just be very lively and have a bit of knowledge about functions! It will be very fun_
